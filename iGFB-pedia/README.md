## Introduction to iGFBs

The landscape of electricity generation and consumption in the European Union is rapidly evolving. The swift adoption of wind and solar energy is leading to a more variable mix of power generation resources. Meanwhile, electric vehicle sales are surging and are expected to become a significant new load on the electrical grid. Substantial investments will be required to upgrade the aging transmission and distribution infrastructure to meet the electricity delivery needs of a modernized grid.
The increasing reliance on electricity will impose new demands on the power system. Additionally, many consumers are now generating or storing electricity on-site, leading to more frequent two-way power flows on the grid.

To address these challenges, a diverse and cost-effective portfolio of flexible resources will be essential. This portfolio will include a mix of generation, demand-side, and storage resources. The EU aims to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels) and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, necessitating a faster decarbonization of electricity generation across the EU.
One critical opportunity lies in better aligning electricity consumption in residential and commercial buildings with the needs and resources of the grid. Buildings account for approximately 40% of the EU's total energy consumption and are responsible for over a third of the EU's energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. For decades, targeted efforts have improved energy efficiency in these buildings, however the pace of change is rather slow. Additionally, the load of some buildings has been managed to reduce electric power use during peak demand times, when the grid is most stressed, expensive to operate, and often has the highest CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, the total number of buildings participating in such schemes is negligible. 

There are further opportunities to better coordinate building electricity use, particularly by integrating the growing number of buildings equipped with Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) with grid conditions to address the evolving challenges on the power system. The adoption of new energy technologies by consumers will introduce opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and flexibility of electricity consumption, benefiting both building owners and occupants, as well as the broader distribution system.

In this light, Intelligent Grid-Forming Buildings (iGFBs) are equipped with smart technologies that enable two-way communication between users and the electricity as well as heating “grid” (network). This facilitates the continuous optimization of energy use for grid services, occupant needs and preferences, climate mitigation, and cost reductions. iGFBs can play a crucial role in enhancing affordability and reliability across the EU power system. Moreover, they can reduce greenhouse gas emissions through lower overall energy use and increased demand flexibility, which aids in the integration of renewable generation. The contributions of iGFBs can be categorized into five areas: improving energy efficiency, shedding power load, shifting power load, modulating power load, and self-consuming through power generation using DERs.

iGFBs primarily offer economic value and autonomy directly to electricity and heating energy consumers. iGFB consumers have the information and means to lower their consumption when prices are high, ultimately resulting in lower bills. Essentially, they enable an economic strategy that aligns consumer behavior with the operational realities of electricity supply, promoting a more stable and efficient energy distribution system. From another perspective, iGFBs modernize, the well-known from the past, practice of electricity consumption during night, leveraging lower pricing due to reduced demand and the difficulty in rapidly adjusting electricity generation from base-load power plants. This practice, reflected in time-of-use tariffs, incentivized consumers to shift their usage, optimizing grid efficiency, reducing waste, and lowering individual energy bills. Nowadays this practice needs to be adapted to a much more multidimensional energy landscape.

### Why Do We Need iGFBs: Social, Economic, and Technological Importance

Intelligent grid-forming buildings represent a transformative approach to energy management, leveraging advanced technologies to enable two-way communication between buildings, energy grids, and market players.

## iGFB Technological Enablers

- **Building Digital Platforms**: Foundational software to manage, monitor, and optimize building energy use.
Intelligent grid-forming buildings are evolving to become active participants in the energy ecosystem, not just passive consumers. To enable this, it is essential to connect existing local digital platforms—such as Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) and Building Automation Systems (BAS)—with broader dataspaces used for exchanging data with third parties (e.g., grid operators, energy markets, service providers).
Key reasons for this integration include:
•	Enabling Grid Interactivity and Flexibility: Buildings equipped with digital platforms can respond to real-time grid signals, optimize energy consumption, and participate in demand response or local energy markets. This requires seamless data exchange between local systems and external stakeholders.
•	Supporting Distributed Energy Resources (DER): Integration allows buildings to coordinate on-site generation (solar, batteries), storage, and flexible loads with grid needs, enhancing grid stability and enabling services like frequency regulation or peak shaving.
•	Facilitating Advanced Energy Management: Access to external data (e.g., tariffs, weather, grid status) and the ability to share building data supports predictive control, optimization, and AI-driven automation for energy efficiency and cost savings.
•	Regulatory and Market Participation: Many emerging energy services, incentives, and regulatory requirements depend on standardized, secure, and auditable data exchanges between buildings and third parties.

Connecting local digital platforms with external dataspaces brings several technical and operational requirements:
1. Interoperability and Standardization
•	Systems must use standardized data models and protocols to ensure compatibility (e.g., IEC 61850, BACnet, OpenADR).
•	Information models and APIs must support the exchange of relevant data types (energy usage, DER status, flexibility offers).
2. Data Quality and Validation
•	Data shared with third parties must be accurate, timely, and validated for completeness and consistency.
•	Automated routines for data quality assurance are needed to prevent errors in grid operations or market transactions.
3. Secure and Controlled Access
•	Robust cybersecurity measures must protect data exchanges, including authentication, encryption, and access control mechanisms.
•	Privacy requirements must be addressed, especially for residential data.
4. Real-Time and Reliable Communication
•	Low-latency, high-availability communication channels are needed for real-time grid interaction and control signals.
•	Systems must support both event-driven and scheduled data exchanges.
5. Scalability and Flexibility
•	Architectures should support integration of diverse devices and platforms, accommodating future upgrades and new use cases.
•	Modular, open platforms are preferred to avoid vendor lock-in and enable ecosystem growt.
6. Data Governance and Ownership
•	Clear policies must define data ownership, usage rights, and responsibilities among building owners, operators, and third parties.
7. Compliance with Regulatory Frameworks

- **Real-time Controllers**: Coordinate operations across multiple energy assets in real-time.
The Real-Time Controller (RTC) is crucial to the operation of intelligent Grid Forming Buildings (iGFBs). Within an iGFB building module, the Building Management System (BMS) creates energy management schedules, which the RTC then executes. The RTC can interact with iGFB assets either directly or via the Building Automation System (BAS).
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07b57865-0fc3-4774-b020-ce6b74ee3e99)

 
As depicted in the accompanying figure, the Real-Time Controller (RTC) plays a central role in managing building operations. Its core responsibility is to ensure the accurate implementation of operational schedules provided by the Intelligent WeForming Operation Framework.
The RTC receives a set of reference signals from the scheduling service, detailing operational plans over diverse timeframes (5 minutes to 24 hours). These plans are customized for various controllable assets, including but not limited to Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), EV chargers, PV trimming, Heat Pumps (HP), and Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units.
The service also supplies the RTC with forecasted data, such as predicted solar radiation, demand forecasts, and expected battery state of charge. To guarantee precise schedule execution, the RTC must also receive current operative state information for each controllable asset. Consequently, asset state data needs to be meticulously recorded and transmitted to the RTC. Additional metered data may be sent to the RTC based on the specific asset type and operational framework.
Alternatively, controller tasks can be individual, with each task assigned to a separate hardware unit, as illustrated in the accompanying figure. In this setup, there is no central Real-Time Controller (RTC) unit. Instead, hardware is selected based on the specific controller task it will host. This distributed RTC approach offers greater flexibility for implementing diverse software, algorithms, and accessibility protocols.

- **Electrical and Thermal Power Processing Hubs**: Manage the conversion, distribution, and storage of energy within buildings.  
- **Buildings’ Digital Models and Digital Twins**: Provide real-time simulation and optimization tools.
Building Information Modelling (BIM) as a process defines the management and creation of construction models and their associated data. BIM models are regarded as a source of information on several nearby domains, ranging from GIS applications to cost analysis, energy simulation software and more recently are seen as a main provider of data for digital twins in the building sector. The BIM models themselves come in different shapes and sizes when it comes to their data models, but at large, the research and industry communities look to the IFC schemas (in various formats and versions) as a meta model for organizing the information about construction projects, and implicitly buildings. IFC provides simple definitions for most building elements (structure, mechanical, plumbing, electric, etc.), including those associated to smart buildings (sensors, actuators). More importantly, the IFC schema provides semantic mechanisms to model interrelationships between various types of elements, such as: hierarchies, connections, aggregations, etc.
Digital Twins (DTs) offer a powerful solution to model, simulate, and optimize the complex interactions between the buildings and the networks, by providing virtual representations of physical systems, enabling the simulation of technologies and processes before implementation or for continuous improvement of their activity allowing for anticipate scenarios and test operational solutions. The use of DTs in intelligent Grid Forming Buildings contributes for enhancing reliability, risks reduction and facilitates continuous improvement while minimizing costs for stakeholders. Within the WeForming project, Digital Twins play a crucial role in testing and validating building-to-grid approaches across the six demonstrators. The co-simulation of the various technologies and processes helps in planning, operation, and exploitation of iGFBs within their energy ecosystems encompassing multi-carrier, multi-sector, and multi-user systems, and their interoperability with energy grids and markets. Within the WeForming project, DTs play a crucial role in simulating physical system components and potential services before their actual implementation by leveraging mathematical models, data-driven analytics, and real-time synchronization with physical systems. The scenario testing enhances reliability and facilitates continuous improvement but also reduces risks and associated costs for building owners, facility managers, operators, and end-users, contributing to:
•	Risk Mitigation: Identify and mitigate potential issues before implementation.
•	Regulatory Compliance: Align with standards and frameworks to ensure interoperability.
•	Enhance Energy Efficiency: Implement strategies that reduce energy consumption and optimize the use of renewable resources.
•	Improve Grid Interaction: Strengthen the interoperability between buildings and the grid, offering services that support grid stability and resilience.
•	Innovate Business Models: Explore new revenue streams and business opportunities arising from advanced energy management and market participation.

The diversity of technological assets, processes, and envisioned services across the WeForming demonstrators requires a structured framework for harmonizing the heterogeneous data models, ensuring that the DT platforms accurately reflect the complexity of the demonstrators. The first step in this process is to define the requirements and methodologies for developing these digital models. These must be flexible enough to represent a wide array of systems, from energy generation and storage to occupant behaviour and market participation, while also being interoperable with the W-IBRA middleware operational layer. The following Figure explains the framework.

- **AI/ML Tools**: Drive intelligent decision-making for energy use and coordination.  
The global energy sector is experiencing a profound shift towards decentralized, sustainable, and community-centric energy systems. Energy communities, where local consumers and producers collaborate to manage energy generation and consumption, are pivotal to this transformation. These communities aim to boost energy efficiency, cut costs, and integrate renewable energy sources. Crucially, accurate electricity demand forecasting is essential for efficient energy distribution, optimal resource allocation, and enhanced grid stability within these localized networks.

However, forecasting electricity demand in energy communities presents unique challenges not seen in traditional centralized systems. The inherent variability of renewable energy generation, influenced by factors like weather and user behavior, introduces significant uncertainty. Additionally, the smaller scale and higher granularity of data within these communities necessitate advanced modeling techniques capable of capturing complex, non-linear consumption patterns more effectively than conventional methods.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have emerged as powerful tools to address these complexities. By leveraging large datasets and sophisticated algorithms, AI/ML methods can uncover hidden patterns, adapt to dynamic conditions, and deliver more accurate demand forecasts than traditional statistical approaches. Techniques such as neural networks, support vector machines, ensemble learning, and deep learning architectures have demonstrated considerable promise in modeling the intricate details of electricity demand within energy communities. Deep learning methods like DeepAR, Deep Belief Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are particularly effective for time series data, handling non-linear relationships and long-term dependencies.

The analysis in the following Figure comprehensively examines the application of AI/ML methods to electricity demand forecasting in energy communities. It explores the range of algorithms and techniques used, assesses their effectiveness and limitations in capturing community-level energy characteristics, and identifies implementation challenges such as data privacy, real-time processing needs, and issues with model interpretability and scalability. Furthermore, the review delves into future directions and emerging trends in AI/ML that could further enhance forecasting accuracy and support the development of smarter energy communities.

Beyond forecasting, advanced control strategies like Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) are also being explored for energy management in these systems. MPC optimizes control actions based on predicted future behavior and a system model, while DRL trains agents to make sequential decisions by maximizing cumulative rewards, particularly useful in complex environments where explicit modeling is difficult. Hybrid approaches combining MPC and DRL are also being developed to leverage the strengths of both methods, offering a robust solution for managing complex and uncertain energy systems.
